-> Obtained from : https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Note that I have used my Google Drive folder as working directory when reading the files. If you wish to run the code, please change the working directory where all data is present in your local or drive.

R Script
Part 1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Reading of files (training, test, feature, activity)
- Assigning variable names
- Merging into one data set


Part 2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Reading of variable names
- Created vector for ID, mean, and standard deivation
- Created subsetes from the merged data 

Part 3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Part 4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

Part 5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- Created a second tidy data set
- Write it into text file
